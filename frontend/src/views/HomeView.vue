      <p><strong>Live Mouse Tracker (LMT)</strong> is a powerful tool to investigate the behavior of mice and in particular social behaviors.<br />
        <strong>LMT</strong> stores the data in a database as a SQLite file. Exploiting the results requires computer skills that many biologists do not always have.<br />
        <strong>LMT-toolkit</strong> is there to help LMT users to analyze their data. As a first step, <strong>LMT-toolkit</strong> provide a reliability check of the LMT experiments.<br />
        Soon, LMT users will be able to manage their LMT experiment with <strong>LMT-toolkit</strong> and their analysis.
