    "# Live Mouse Tracker Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims at providing all the basics needed to perform the analysis of the data provided by LiveMouseTracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "We detail what the system records, and how to process it. This file also points to a number of scripts that you will use for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook on your computer with Jupyter, proceed as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Download [this python repository](https://github.com/fdechaumont/lmt-analysis) and unzip it in a folder on your computer. (note that Jupyter will only let you browse files starting from your home directory. So place this folder in your documents or on your desktop for instance)\n",
    "   - Install [Anaconda with python v3.x](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).\n",
    "   - And then launch \"Jupyter Notebook\".\n",
    "   - Browse to this file on your local computer and then press play. :)\n",
    "   - Here is a cool [video about Jupyter and how to start with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwFq3YDU6_Y) to get a brief overview of what you can do with it.\n",
    "   - Once installed, we recommend to bookmark this page in your browser.\n",

    "# Main concepts of Live Mouse Tracker:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Live Mouse Tracker provides two main outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LiveMouseTracker records data in a database. Those files are .sqlite files. They contains \n",
    "    \n",
    "   - The id of each animal (their RFID number, and also the genotypes of mice if you provide them)\n",
    "   - All the tracking information (detection, tracks, detection mask of animals )\n",
    "   - All the events (for instance nose-nose events) with a starting and ending frame.\n",
    "   - Sensor information (temperature, humidity, light, noise level)\n",
    "   - Third party events (events generated from an Arduino or a custom TTL device)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Video files, in mp4 format, containing the same view that you had in LiveMouseTracker while performing the record.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Frame number and clock\n",
    "\n",
    "The time unit of LiveMouseTracker is the frame. The recording is performed at 30 frames per seconds. Each event starts and ends at a given frame. For each frame, we record its date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video file, the frame number is hard-coded at the bottom of the video so that you can find the exact frame in the video where an event occurs.\n",
    "Also, in the LiveDataPlayer, the frame number is always visible which helps you checking with the video file if needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "|Example of video output of the tracker with 2 animals. <br>**Top line**: Current date and time, available memory. Second line: temperature, humidity , snd(sound level), light(Visible+IR), light(Visible). <br> **Left side**: view of each animal (oriented verticaly), with RFID number, Z-profile, and rearing, look up and look down info. (black/white): not active, active.) <br>**Bottom line**: t:frame number and equivalent hours/minute/second/frame. Realtime experiment duration (should differ from t if the system has framedrop. Typical drift is half a second for 1 day). CPU time needed for 1 image (here 9ms. Will switch to red if the computer cannot compute a frame), % of CPU used. <br> **Yellow circles**: show each antenna with their respective COM port number, the number of actual RFID reading over the number of read attempt. <br>**Note that we put the house at the bottom-left of the cage, and water is provided though a hole in the wall at the bottom-right of the cage**.|\n",
    "    \n",
    "## About the events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Events are key in LiveMouseTracker. You will mostly use LMT to check the number of events that occurs during a period, their length, their frequency, how they may be synchronized with other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each event can refer to 4 ids (idA,idB,idC,idD). If you want to grab information about the oral-genital event between animal 2 and 4, you just need to specify IDs to select those events. Note that Oral-Genital 2,4 will provide a different result than Oral-Genital 4,2 as the event is directed. For symetrical events such as Oral-Oral, (2,4) and (4,2) will provide the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- More about the events and timelines in the [Interactive query example](examples/Examples with Jupyter - Interactive query.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Live Mouse tracker creates a database with a number of events that are computed live, but most of the events are computed in a post processing. To process them use the [Rebuild all events script](scripts/Rebuild all events.ipynb).\n",

    "| Events available after post processing |\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of analysis script will need the genotype of your animals. Use the [Set genotype](scripts/SetGenotype.ipynb) script to set them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can set for each experiment the duration of night. Either \n",
